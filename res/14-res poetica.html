<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A <i>relation</i> is a real thing, i.e. has a physio-neuronal</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The<i> res poetica</i> is a relation realized through poetry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a space akin to what George Oppen had in mind when</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he, following Shelley, called poets “the legislators of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the unacknowledged world.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not like “a city upon a hill” (which "cannot be hidden").</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poets are real: poets make poetry, or its algorithms, and think</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of themselves, and represent themselves, as poets.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In defining the limits of the <i>res poetica</i>, take Wallace</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stevens’s claim that “We live in the mind” in equal</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">measure with Elaine Scarry’s demonstrations of the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ways mind can be reduced, with violence, to body.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poets come out of what Bishnupriya Ghosh calls</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“local struggles,” which arise from shifting sets of conditions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and cannot be represented from a single perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The production, dissemination, and reception of poetry are</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">part of a projection of the space of such struggles</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">into another space, the <i>res poetica</i>, a model state.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">FORM IS NEVER MORE THAN AN EXTENSION</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">OF CONTENT, and can thereby be open</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to various forms of evaluation, which can result</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anne-Lise François, following Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">calls an <i>open secret</i> a “gesture of self-canceling</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">revelation [that] permits a release from the ethical</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">imperative to act upon knowledge” in environments</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of threat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An open secret is “an essentially preventative or conservative</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mode of communication that reveals to insiders what</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it simultaneously hides from outsiders, or, more</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">specifically, protects them from what it is in their</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">power to ignore.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poetry can be an open secret, “a way of imparting knowledge</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">such that it cannot be claimed and acted on.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <i>res poetica</i> can be a compact to transmit and maintain</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">knowledge in the face of tacit or explicit threat,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">through an articulation, or a non-articulation.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">characterizes as “one of the most highly regarded</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">books of Hindi poetry from the 1980s” and “among</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the best books of poetry I have ever read” — can be</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">read as an open secret.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Narayanan says Verma’s “ambiguous invocations of half-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mythical South Asian cities bring Borges and Cavafy</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">automatically to mind, but there is also a canny and</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">even bitter political outrage… that sets him apart,”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and that makes me think of Mandelstam,</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Bizarrely,” Narayanan writes, “Verma was a senior</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Congress Party functionary under Indira Gandhi</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the late 70s and early 80s — it’s hard, for me at least,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to resist reading <i>Magadh</i> as his way of speaking</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about some aspects of that close-up experience in the</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When realized as a particular instantiation of the <i>res poetica</i>,</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">histories and sets of perceptions and inheritances into</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">temporally continuous or discontinuous, but</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">materially real.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is the <i>res poetica</i>, rather than a poem or poetry, that brings</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of instantiations of the <i>res poetica</i>, i.e. a negotiation</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poetry has its own particular modes of reception, rather than</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a fixed and identifiable set formal characteristics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Reception, as defined by Auerbach, is a “subjectivistic-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">perspectivalistic procedure,” one that, under certain</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">conditions, “creat[es] a foreground and a</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">background, resulting in the present lying open to the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">depths of the past.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The production, dissemination, and reception of poetry, is,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">even in negation, an act of affirmation, one that</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">creates a relation, the <i>res poetica</i>.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A mode of communication is like S&amp;M: without permission,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">without mutuality, it becomes violence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poetry is capable of sustaining any form of ironic</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">communication.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poetry can attempt to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">recapitulate and reiterate stereotypes without the</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">poem’s author function seeming to be a node for</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">drawing pleasure in discharge from the stereotypes</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or, in an ironic effort to drain</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the stereotypes of charge,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the node may draw pleasure in disgust,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">as a sign of self-implication,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a white flag.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pleasure in disgust, and pleasure generally, can freak people</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">out.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <i>res poetica</i> requires constant renegotiation of forms of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">permission.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deriving pleasure from disgust and deriving pleasure from</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">re-iterating stereotypes can, during discontinuous</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">communicative acts, look like the same thing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I once published a poem that contained the lines “The Asian</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">woman sat eating Tam crackers / I laughed /  This</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stuff is endless.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I first read the poem at Halcyon in Brooklyn in 2000,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a member of the audience had a visible visceral</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reaction to those lines, and the <i>res poetica</i>, running</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">like a current through that moment, was damaged</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and reduced.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“[t]he nebulous core shared by all cosmopolitan</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their political affiliation, do (or at least can) belong to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a single community, and that this community should</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Seyla Benhabib contends that “since the UN Declaration of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Human Rights in 1948, we have entered a new phase</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the evolution of global civil society, which is</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">characterized by a transition from international</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to cosmopolitan forms of justice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“[W]hatever the conditions of their legal origination,”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Benhabib continues, cosmopolitan forms of justice</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“accrue to individuals as moral and legal persons</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the same time, Pollock wants to “think about</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cosmopolitanism and vernacularism as action rather</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">than idea, as something people do rather than</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">something they declare, as practice rather than</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">proposition (least of all, philosophical proposition),”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and also as a <i>choice</i>, one which in turn “enables us to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">see that some people in the past have been able to be</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cosmopolitan or vernacular without directly</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">professing either, perhaps while finding it impossible</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rationally to justify either.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the time of its dominance, Latin was a cosmopolitanist</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">idiom, and English, Spanish, German and Italian</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the time of its dominance, Sanskrit was a cosmopolitanist</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For some, English, as American global cosmopolitanist dominant,</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Speakers of a closed perceived cosmopolitanist dominant</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">can access re-representations of vernacular FORMS</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but not to the conventional meaning structures associated</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A response to lack of access to all of the conventional</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">meanings of, for example, Tamil film musicals, is to</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">vernacular into a kind of super-ordinate neo-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cosmopolitanist idiom, via, for example, heightened</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cuts, homophonics, or pasted voice-overs, which are</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">forms of, among other things, simulating</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to fulfill its implicit promise</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of total access is not quite ironized in the work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The failure of a vernacular to signify across</span></p>
