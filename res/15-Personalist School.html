<p><span style="color: #000000;">Frank O’Hara’s “<a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/20421">Personism: A Manifesto</a>” (1959) can be read as a parody of Personalism, of related strands of 1950s American psychology, and of the poetry that developed alongside them.</span></p>
<span style="color: #000000;">Gordon W. Allport (1897-1967) created and taught the course “Personality: its Psychological and Social Aspects” at Harvard in 1924.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The course was the first at a U.S. college to treat personality theory as a discrete branch of psychology.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allport joined Harvard’s psychology faculty in 1930, and, in 1937, published <em>Personality: A Psychological Interpretation</em>, which became the standard U.S. textbook of personality theory.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allport’s 1954 book <em>The Nature of Prejudice</em>, which describes prejudice in terms of “In-Groups,” “Out-Groups,” “ego defenses” and “rejection,” arrived at the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement, and sold more than a half-million copies in the U.S. over the next 25 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When Allport’s <em>Becoming: Basic Considerations for a Psychology of Personality</em> was published the following year, it received more attention than a set of essays on personality theory normally would.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In <em>Becoming</em>, Allport elaborates the concept of the “proprium” (or self) partially through “Personalism,” a long-extant philosophical construct with multiple contradictory meanings.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allport’s Personalism describes every mental function as embedded in “personal life”—there is no separable symbol processing or space perception; there are only people who have senses, feelings, and impressions.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Personologist—a real Allport construct—asks “How shall a psychological life history be written?” and “What are the individual consistencies?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Depth psychology “may plunge too deep”; “being in the moment” and “being present” are the keys to psychotherapy and to development.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allport used the terms “proprium” and “Personalism” to distinguish his constructs from the nascent “Self” psychology of Heinz Kohut (1913-1981), and from work by Abraham Maslow (1908-1970).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In a 1943 paper titled “A Theory of Human Motivation,” Maslow adopted Kurt Goldstein’s concept of “self-actualization” and placed it atop a “hierarchy of human needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Maslow defines “self-actualization” as “the desire for self-fulfillment, namely the tendency for man to become actualized in what he is potentially.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Carl Rogers (1902-1987), in <em>Client-Centered Therapy</em> (1951), favors terminology whereby it is the “client” who “has within himself or herself vast resources for self-understanding, for altering his or her self-concept, attitudes and self-directed behavior,” which are resources that require “a definable climate of facilitative psychological attitudes” adding up to the “freedom to be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Allport’s “person” may have also been defined against Rogers’s “client.”</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">O’Hara, who graduated from Harvard in 1950, writes that he “founded” Personism “on August 27, 1959,” in conversation with Amiri Baraka.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Personism: A Manifesto” was dated September 3, 1959 when it appeared in the magazine <em>Yugen</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">M.L. Rosenthal’s review of Robert Lowell’s <em>Life Studies</em>, titled “Poetry as Confession,” appeared in <em>The Nation</em> issue dated September 19, 1959.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Rosenthal chose the term “confession” to recall Lowell’s 1940 conversion to Catholicism, much discussed when Lowell won the 1947 Pulitzer Prize, at age 30, for <em>Lord Weary’s Castle</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In his review, Rosenthal says that <em>Life Studies</em> contains the equivalent of “a series of personal confidences, rather shameful, that one is honor-bound not to reveal,” and that Lowell himself “seems to regard” the book as “soul’s therapy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In interviews at the time, Lowell said the composition of <em>Life Studies</em> was part of his psychotherapy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Everything is in the poems,” O’Hara says at the opening of “Personism” “but at the risk of sounding like the poor wealthy man’s Allen Ginsberg I will write to you because I just heard that one of my fellow poets thinks that a poem of mine that can’t be got at one reading is because I was confused too.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“Now, come on. I don’t believe in god, so I don’t have to make elaborately sounded structures.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">“I hate Vachel Lindsay, always have; I don’t even like rhythm, assonance, all that stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The reference to believers creating “elaborately sounded structures” is probably a reference to Lowell and the highly-wrought <em>Weary</em>, and maybe to T.S. Eliot.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Vachel Lindsay, who committed suicide in 1931 by drinking Lysol (“They tried to get me—I got them first!”), was known as a socialist, and a moralist: “Would I might rouse the Lincoln in you all!”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The parsing of poetic form using traditional metrics (rhythm, assonance) was a hallmark of the New Critics.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">O’Hara often delivered similar ripostes to the generation just slightly older than his: “Memorial Day 1950” contains the line “Our responsibilities did not begin/ in dreams, though they began in bed,” which inverts Delmore Schwartz’s “In Dreams Begin Responsibilities” (itself a borrowing from Yeats).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Other readings of Personism <a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5908">look past parody</a> (and also note its engagement with Surrealist manifesto).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">At a time when Allport was still at Harvard (where he taught until his death), John Ashbery wrote his undergraduate thesis for F.O. Matthiessen on Wallace Stevens’s “Chocorua to Its Neighbor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The poem, first published in 1933, was collected in 1947’s <em>Transport to Summer</em> (and is obliquely invoked in <em>The Pisan Cantos</em>).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ashbery’s use of quotation throughout <em>Some Trees</em>, selected by W.H. Auden in 1956 for the Yale Younger Poets series, echoes the vatic emptiness of Chocorua’s reporting of what it heard from within a “shadow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Stevens and Ashbery have both, in somewhat different ways, been accused of being reactionary.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Stevens’s poetry was, in contemporary reviews, denounced as something like, in the self-description of John Wilkinson, neo-baroque flummery.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Robert Frost, probably thinking of Dorothy Parker’s 1928 poem, said that Stevens wrote poems about “Bric-a-Brac.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And “Personism is to Wallace Stevens what <em>la poésie pure</em> was to Béranger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The conditions that produced Wallace Stevens have disappeared; the postmodern of Ashbery, as Joshua Clover has noted, has disappeared, or is disappearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The mainstream, or mainstreaming process, remains the same regardless of the system to which it is hooked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Mayakovsky was a mainstream poet.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Every era really does get the poetry it deserves, but description is not always subscription.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Though accused of it in his moment, Stevens does not refuse what Clover has called poetry’s task, or obligation: to “figure a disposition” toward “possession and dispossession.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Possession and dispossession are the poles of the “fundamental antagonism” described systematically by Marx.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">For now, possession and dispossession are constitutive of, and inextricable from, the conditions in which poetry is realized, “not eternal and abstract but concrete and historical,” longstanding and contingent.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The fundamental antagonism, itself historically contingent, manifests itself through sets of appearances, which are concrete, and which have been called maya, the Matrix, and the 10,000 things.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Lyric, as the discourse of constructing or staging voice (or its lack), has material dependencies, even if invisio-neuronal, like any form.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Material dependency, as the condition of poetry, entails a disposition toward the fundamental antagonism.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Material dependency renders a work that emerges from a default position, that fails to figure disposition toward dispossession, an incomplete expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The positions Stevens’s work actually seems to take with regard to the fundamental antagonism, or the period and place incidentals in which it clothes itself, aren’t what moves me in his work.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I don’t respond to the disposition, or dispositions, as a possible modality (or affective modality, if disposition is affect) for our, and even his, now.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I do have a nostalgia for the particular sets of conditions that Stevens isolated in his work.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Jack Spicer’s “practice of outside,” a name for a disposition, projects competing false sets of givens from multiple eras to block collapse into depiction.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The desire to reject obligation or entailment of any kind, poetic or otherwise, including that of staging a disposition, drives some poetry.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Ashbery’s non-staging of certain kinds of positions, as a refusal of any obligation of any kind, becomes a (well-documented) disposition in itself, one that refuses individualized transcendence as a final or outcome state.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the commuter train sequence of Godard’s <em>La Chinoise</em> (1967), talk of revolution, especially that lacking an outcome plan for governance, is staged against art-based model-state dramatizing, and against conventional reformism, as a set of stale-mated impossibilities for destroying the antagonism.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The conclusion that the film seems to reach is that “this situation must change.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the commuter train sequence of Godard’s <em>La Chinoise</em> (1967), talk of revolution, especially that lacking an outcome plan for governance, is staged against art-based model-state dramatizing, and against conventional reformism, as a set of stale-mated impossibilities for destroying the antagonism.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The material sites of struggle between the possessed and dispossessed are subject to mistranslation along the very lines of struggle, of antagonism.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What it looks like to be dispossessed in Patna is obviously different from what it looks like in Passy or Paoli.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Less obviously, it is, always and at every point, difficult to communicate across manifestations of the 10,000 things.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Clover writes that “we need to clutch on to absolute antagonism (its essence)” in order to approach “[t]he irreducible kernel of solidarity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Toscano’s “Eco-Strato-Static,” from <em>Collapsible Poetics Theatre</em>, published by Fence Books in 2008, pulls out, like hitting the minus repeatedly on Google Maps, to show what micro-misunderstanding looks like at the macro.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Stacy Doris’s <em>Cheerleader’s Guide to the World: Council Book</em> (2006) shows the cyclical nature of appearance as human “formations/ and drills.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Juliana Spahr stages the sex and death of sets of misapprehension and appearance in “The Incinerator” (2008).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In <em>Jejuri</em> (1974), Arun Kolatkar dilates the gap between appearance and maladaptive ideal.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The protagonist of <em>La Chinoise</em> returns to school and we never see her again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">On the subway, on my way to work, I watch everything flick back and forth between normalcy and mass effect, like a monstrous duck/rabbit.</span><br />
