Dear Robyn Creswell,

Thank you for publishing poems from Regan Good's The Atlantic House. I'm pretty sure she sent you a copy of the book. Please let me know if not.

I'd be very happy if you'd read the enclosed poem "Cat Washington" and consider it for publication.

I've been living on-and-off in Shillong for almost seven years. The state of Meghalaya, of which Shillong is the captial, was carved out of Assam along ethnic-linguistic lines in the early 1970s. It's a small state, and Shillong is a lot like Providence. We live in my wife's family's house, where I spend most of my time, in a rapidly gentrifying post-rural district. The poem is set there. There are two unglossed terms in it: "Neem" is not the Indian tree but the oil derived from it, which is used in cleaning products, toothpaste. "Thlone" means "lisp" in Khasi, the language of my wife's family.

I worked at Publishers Weekly from 1995-2008. I was poetry editor there, among other things; at layoff, I was doing fiction. Since then I've been working as a programmer, mostly under the title Computational Linguist. I have a B.A. from Vassar in Cognitive Science, an M.A. in Linguistics from Brown, and an M. Phil in English from CUNY. I'm editor and publisher of Harry Tankoos Books. I had a column in Poets & Writers in the late 1990s called Metromania. My three full-length books are Telemachiad, Vérité, and For Kid Rock / Total Freedom. My most recent publications are an online chapbook, Autoportraits from an Earlier Era, in 2010 (in the now-defunct journal Sustainable Aircraft), and four poems in the online journal Blackbox Manifold, in 2012.


Sincerely,
